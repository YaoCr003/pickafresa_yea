transforms:
  # Camera TCP offset from tool flange (as defined in RDK)
  # Format: [x, y, z]mm | Rot[u, v, w]deg
  # This represents the camera optical center position relative to the robot flange

  gripper_tcp:
    translation_mm: [0.0, 0.0, 57]
    rotation_deg: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
  
  # Offset adjustments for pick/prepick points
  # All offsets are in berry/fruit coordinate frame where:
  #   Z+ = away from camera (into the fruit)
  #   Z- = toward camera (away from fruit)
  # For overhead picking: positive Z goes UP (away from fruit), negative Z goes DOWN (into fruit)
  pick_offset:
    # Pre-pick position offset (approach position before actual pick)
    prepick_offset_mm: [0.0, 100.0, 0.0]  # [x, y, z] offset from fruit center
                                           # Default: 100mm above fruit (positive Z)
    prepick_rotation_deg: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] # [u, v, w] absolute rotation for prepick pose
    
    # Pick position offset (actual grasp point)
    pick_offset_mm: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]       # [x, y, z] offset from fruit center

    place_offset_mm: [0.0, 0.0, 50.0]     # Offset for place position from pick

# ==============================================================================
# POST-PICK DETACHMENT MANEUVERS
# ==============================================================================
post_pick:
  # Enable/disable post-pick detachment sequence
  # After gripping the berry, execute a series of movements to detach it from the plant
  # These targets are auto-generated relative to the pick position
  enabled: true
  
  # Number of post-pick targets to generate (1-3 typical)
  num_targets: 2
  
  # Rotation mode: "absolute" or "cumulative"
  # - "absolute": Rotations specified in BASE frame axes, composed with current orientation
  #               (e.g., [-70, 0, 0] = 70° rotation around base X-axis, applied to current pose)
  #               First target rotates from pick orientation, subsequent ones build on that
  # - "cumulative": Rotations in LOCAL frame axes (current gripper orientation)
  #               (e.g., [-70, 0, 0] = 70° twist around gripper's current forward axis)
  rotation_mode: "cumulative"
  
  # Post-pick target configurations (cumulative offsets from pick position)
  # Each target builds upon the previous one's POSITION (always cumulative)
  # 
  # TWO CONTROL MODES PER TARGET:
  # ==============================
  # 
  # MODE 1: CARTESIAN CONTROL (current/default)
  # --------------------------------------------
  # Use offset_mm and rotation_deg for Cartesian space control
  # - Offsets are in berry/fruit coordinate frame (or current frame if rotation_mode="cumulative")
  # - Rotations use axis-angle representation [u, v, w] in degrees via Rodrigues formula
  # - In "absolute" mode: Rotation axes are BASE FRAME (UR3e base)
  #   - rotation_deg: [-70, 0, 0] means 70° rotation around base X-axis
  #   - Applied ON TOP of current orientation (builds up from pick)
  # - In "cumulative" mode: Rotation axes are CURRENT GRIPPER FRAME  
  #   - rotation_deg: [-70, 0, 0] means 70° twist around gripper's forward direction
  #   - Each rotation happens in the new orientation from previous step
  #
  # MODE 2: JOINT SPACE CONTROL (NEW - for precise singularity-free maneuvers)
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Use joint_deltas_deg to directly specify joint angle changes
  # - Format: [j0, j1, j2, j3, j4, j5] - deltas in degrees for each joint
  # - Cumulative: Each target's deltas are relative to the previous joint configuration
  # - Example: [0, 5.0, -3.0, 0, 0, 2.0] moves j1 by +5°, j2 by -3°, j5 by +2°
  # - Useful for: avoiding singularities, precise local maneuvers, small adjustments
  # - When joint_deltas_deg is present, offset_mm and rotation_deg are IGNORED
  # - Recommended move_type: "joint" for smooth joint-space interpolation
  #
  # Target selection: If joint_deltas_deg exists, use joint control; else use Cartesian

# MULTI-STAGE CAPTURE CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================
multi_stage_capture:
  # Enable/disable multi-stage capture refinement
  # Stage 1: Initial capture at Foto target (always executed)
  # Stage 2: Alignment capture - move to center berry in image
  # Stage 3: Prepick refinement - capture from prepick position

    adjust_orientation: true          # Adjust orientation to align camera Z-axis with berry Z-axis
    
    # Stage 2 Alignment Strategy:
    # ============================
    # Positions camera TCP perpendicular to berry frame for optimal capture
    #
    # Berry Frame (from PnP):
    #   - Origin: at berry surface center
    #   - Z-axis: points away from camera (into fruit depth)
    #   - X,Y axes: define berry plane orientation
    #
    # Camera Alignment:
    #   1. Camera X,Y position matches berry X,Y (no lateral offset)
    #   2. Camera positioned along berry -Z axis (back from berry)
    #   3. Camera Z-axis parallel to berry Z-axis (both point toward fruit)
    #   4. Distance controlled by stage2_offset_mm[2] (standoff distance)
    #
    # Transform handling:
    #   - Gripper TCP is the active RoboDK TCP
    #   - Camera TCP pose calculated, then converted to gripper TCP for motion
    #   - Transform: T_base_gripper = T_base_camera @ inv(T_flange_camera) @ T_flange_gripper
    #
    # Configuration:
    #   stage2_offset_mm[2]: Distance from camera to berry along berry Z-axis (mm)
    #   - Positive value = camera positioned back from berry
    #   - Example: [0, 0, 250] = camera 250mm back from berry surface
    #   - Only Z component used; X,Y forced to zero (no lateral offset)
    stage2_offset_mm: [0.0, 0.0, 220]  # [x, y, z] - only z used for standoff distance
    stage2_rotation_deg: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # [u, v, w] additional rotation offset (applied to camera frame)
