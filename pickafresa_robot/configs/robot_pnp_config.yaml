    rotation_deg: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
  
  # Offset adjustments for pick/prepick points
  # All offsets are in berry/fruit coordinate frame where:
  #   Z+ = away from camera (into the fruit)
  #   Z- = toward camera (away from fruit)
  # For overhead picking: positive Z goes UP (away from fruit), negative Z goes DOWN (into fruit)

# ==============================================================================
# POST-PICK DETACHMENT MANEUVERS
# ==============================================================================
post_pick:
  # Enable/disable post-pick detachment sequence
  # After gripping the berry, execute a series of movements to detach it from the plant
  # These targets are auto-generated relative to the pick position
  enabled: true
  
  # Number of post-pick targets to generate (1-3 typical)
  num_targets: 2
  
  # Rotation mode: "absolute" or "cumulative"
  # - "absolute": Rotations specified in BASE frame axes, composed with current orientation
  #               (e.g., [-70, 0, 0] = 70° rotation around base X-axis, applied to current pose)
  #               First target rotates from pick orientation, subsequent ones build on that
  # - "cumulative": Rotations in LOCAL frame axes (current gripper orientation)
  #               (e.g., [-70, 0, 0] = 70° twist around gripper's current forward axis)
  rotation_mode: "cumulative"
  
  # Post-pick target configurations (cumulative offsets from pick position)
  # Each target builds upon the previous one's POSITION (always cumulative)
  # Offsets are in berry/fruit coordinate frame (or current frame if rotation_mode="cumulative")
  # Rotations use axis-angle representation [u, v, w] in degrees via Rodrigues formula
  #
  # In "absolute" mode: Rotation axes are BASE FRAME (UR3e base)
  #   - rotation_deg: [-70, 0, 0] means 70° rotation around base X-axis
  #   - Applied ON TOP of current orientation (builds up from pick)
  #
  # In "cumulative" mode: Rotation axes are CURRENT GRIPPER FRAME  
  #   - rotation_deg: [-70, 0, 0] means 70° twist around gripper's forward direction
  #   - Each rotation happens in the new orientation from previous step
  targets:
    - name: "post_pick_detach"

# ==============================================================================
# MULTI-STAGE CAPTURE CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================
multi_stage_capture:
  # Enable/disable multi-stage capture refinement
  # Stage 1: Initial capture at Foto target (always executed)
  # Stage 2: Alignment capture - move to center berry in image
  # Stage 3: Prepick refinement - capture from prepick position

    adjust_orientation: true          # Adjust orientation to align camera Z-axis with berry Z-axis
    
    # Stage 2 Alignment Strategy:
    # ============================
    # Positions camera TCP perpendicular to berry frame for optimal capture
    #
    # Berry Frame (from PnP):
    #   - Origin: at berry surface center
    #   - Z-axis: points away from camera (into fruit depth)
    #   - X,Y axes: define berry plane orientation
    #
    # Camera Alignment:
    #   1. Camera X,Y position matches berry X,Y (no lateral offset)
    #   2. Camera positioned along berry -Z axis (back from berry)
    #   3. Camera Z-axis parallel to berry Z-axis (both point toward fruit)
    #   4. Distance controlled by stage2_offset_mm[2] (standoff distance)
    #
    # Transform handling:
    #   - Gripper TCP is the active RoboDK TCP
    #   - Camera TCP pose calculated, then converted to gripper TCP for motion
    #   - Transform: T_base_gripper = T_base_camera @ inv(T_flange_camera) @ T_flange_gripper
    #
    # Configuration:
    #   stage2_offset_mm[2]: Distance from camera to berry along berry Z-axis (mm)
    #   - Positive value = camera positioned back from berry
    #   - Example: [0, 0, 250] = camera 250mm back from berry surface
    #   - Only Z component used; X,Y forced to zero (no lateral offset)
    stage2_offset_mm: [0.0, 0.0, 220]  # [x, y, z] - only z used for standoff distance
    stage2_rotation_deg: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # [u, v, w] additional rotation offset (applied to camera frame)

    use_geometric_only: true          # Use PnP without depth constraint for refinement
    
    # Offsets for stage3 position (relative to berry position in berry frame)
    # Applied BEFORE the prepick_offset, allowing independent positioning
    # These do not affect the prepick_offset configuration
    stage3_offset_mm: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # [x, y, z] offset from berry for stage3 capture
